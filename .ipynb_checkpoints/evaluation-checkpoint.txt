Being tutored in these sessions one, definitely did help with some of my understanding of a language I am unfamilar with, OCaml. There were little to no errors for either prompt and it was done in a way that I could absolutely understand what it was trying to teach me. Plus, it gave me examples and a problem for me to do on my own which I thought was pretty amazing. What I will say though, is that for the prompt specific one, there are a lot less emojis used. It's as if the AI has become a lot more formal when taking on a "superior" role (like subordinate/upperclassman). There are still some emojis being used, but not as much (which I appreciate since they can be sort of distracting). 

In terms of distractions, no role chatbot could be side tracked incredibly quickly. I simply asked them what their favorite ice cream flavor was, which the no role chatbot immediately answered with "cookies and cream". That was not the case for chatbot in character. It didn't even give a flavor, immediately shutting the question down to get back on track. What was interesting was my second attempt to distract and get them off trail. Both entertained my joke, but tried to move on in different ways. The no role chat asked a question to see if I wanted to move on or continue with the current topic. The chat with a role, however, wanted me to answer the question they asked before attempting to move through or on.
