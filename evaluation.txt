Being tutored in these sessions one, definitely did help with some of my understanding of a language I am unfamilar with, OCaml. There were little to no errors for either prompt and it was done in a way that I could absolutely understand what it was trying to teach me. Plus, it gave me examples and a problem for me to do on my own which I thought was pretty amazing. What I will say though, is that for the prompt specific one, there are a lot less emojis used.

There are still some emojis being used, but not as much (which I appreciate since they can be sort of distracting).
